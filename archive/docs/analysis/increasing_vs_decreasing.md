## Notes

- GFP/ROI collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b, Fz
- P1: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [94.1, 116.7] ms (width: 22.7 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [139.8, 210.2] ms (width: 70.4 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 472 ms, FWHM window [389.9, 549.0] ms (width: 159.1 ms)
- Fz: Peak at 104 ms, FWHM window [91.5, 113.9] ms (width: 22.4 ms)
